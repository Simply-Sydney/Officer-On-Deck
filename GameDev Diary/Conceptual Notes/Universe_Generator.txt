Universe generator should start with universe type selection:
	- Size
	- Shape
	- Age
	
Generator should then populate a map using chosen characteristics and a high speed psuedo-random number generator / noise generator
Generator will then save the result to a file
Planets within systems will be created at a later time utilizing mathmatical models that take star and age characteristics as inputs
	- Example:
		Star is similar to the Sun,
		Planets are randomly generated within the system around the star, with biases (elaborated on later, but will give systems "flavor")
		Planet characteristics are generated using math with their placement and size being inputs
		System and life within it will be changed based on time-from-game-start (Basically "aging up" the system based on how far in game its made)
Empires will be static for the time being, and be generated / handled by seperate system

IDEA (not sure about it):
	"Colonized Space" will be generated along with system, rather than newly discovered systems
	Basically universe generator and system generator will treat colonized space as already "Discovered"
	"Discovered" for the generator will be different and removed from "Discovered" as in what is visable to the player
	
Generation Procedure:
	- Divide screen size (pixels) into 'chunks' which can each hold 1 star sector
	- Use coordinates of chunk to determine whether a star exists there
		- Closer to galactic center means higher likelihood of star existing
