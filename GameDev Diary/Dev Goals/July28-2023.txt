 * Focus: Create Github Repo
 * Sub-Goal: Get universe generator working!
 *******************************
 
 Primary Goal - Create github repo and upload current project in all of its unashamed glory
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
	By end of work period, should have project location setup and uploaded to github
	
 Sub Goal - Finish generator system and have it ready for implementation into map display
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
	- Eliminated galaxy size and type selection to fix bugs and get initial system running first
	- Galaxy generation will not generate planets for every star at this point, just have star systems and a map to display them
