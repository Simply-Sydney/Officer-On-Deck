 * Sub-Goal: Start Work on Universe Generator
 *******************************
 
 Primary Goal - to setup both Monogame and Visual Studio to begin work on the universe generator system
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
	By end of work period, should have project location setup as well as some begining files to hold the generator

 Sub Goal - to start working on universe generator system
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
    - System should create and save a persistant and random universe containing systems and planets with unique features
	- System should base planetary features on core attributes of the system, star type, and interacting characteristics
		- Example:
			Star is an orange G2V class star (Based on Sun)
				- Star effective tempurature is 5770K
				- Star habitability zone is .85 - 1.5 AU
			Planet A is .35 AU from star (Based on Mercury)
				- Planet A is mostly molten rock
					- Planet A has metal content of 4/10
				- Planet A orbital period is 88 Earth Days
				- Planet A is .38 Earth Radius
				- Planet A surface gravity is .37G
				- Planet A effective (blackbody) tempurature is 437K
			Planet B is 9.5 AU from star (Based on Saturn)
				- Planet B is a gas giant
				- Planet B orbital period is 29.4 Earth Years
				- Planet B is 9.1 Earth Radius
				- Planet B contains hydrogen-helium gas
				- Planet B surface gravity is 1.05G
				- Planet B effective (blackbody) tempurature is 135K
			Asteroid field is 4.3 AU from star
				- Rock type, etc goes here
			Gas Cloud is 25.6 AU from star
				- Size and gasses included goes here
		-Should use mathmatical models and formulas to determine more characteristics from base ones such as size and distance from star
